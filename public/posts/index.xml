&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limelight hydrangeas (Hydrangea paniculata &amp;lsquo;Limelight&amp;rsquo;) are a stunning addition to any garden, renowned for their vibrant lime-green blossoms that command attention throughout the summer and into the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These hardy deciduous shrubs boast large, cone-shaped flower heads that gradually transition from a creamy white in early summer to a dazzling lime-green hue as the season progresses. As autumn approaches, Limelight hydrangeas undergo yet another transformation, turning shades of pink, burgundy, and deep red, adding a spectacular finale to the garden landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most appealing features of Limelight hydrangeas is their versatility and adaptability to various growing conditions. They thrive in full sun to partial shade and are tolerant of different soil types, provided they are well-drained. With proper care, including regular watering and occasional pruning to shape and encourage new growth, Limelight hydrangeas can reach heights of up to eight feet, making them ideal as focal points in borders or as striking additions to mixed shrub plantings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether showcased as a single specimen or mass-planted for dramatic effect, Limelight hydrangeas captivate with their enduring beauty and serve as a beacon of color and charm in any garden setting.&lt;/p&gt;
